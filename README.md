# Privacy Policy for Intestigator

**Last Updated: January 20, 2026**

## Overview

Intestigator is a self-help pattern discovery tool that helps you log meals, drinks, supplements, and digestive symptoms to identify potential trigger patterns. It is designed to help you prepare for conversations with healthcare providers—it does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations.

Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how your data is handled.

## Data Storage

All data you enter in Intestigator is stored **100% on your device** and optionally synced to your personal iCloud account. This means:

- Your data stays on your device and in **your own** iCloud account
- We have **no access** to your logged entries, symptoms, or patterns
- We do not operate servers that store your personal data
- Your data is protected by Apple's device and iCloud security

## Data We Collect

**We do not collect your personal data.** Specifically:

- No access to your food logs, symptom entries, or insights
- No analytics or usage tracking
- No crash reporting sent to us
- No advertising identifiers
- No third-party services that collect data

## Data Sharing

We do not share your data with anyone. Your information never leaves your device except to sync with your own iCloud account.

## iCloud Sync

If you have iCloud enabled, Intestigator can sync your data across your Apple devices. This sync is:

- Encrypted in transit and at rest by Apple
- Stored in your private iCloud container
- Controlled by your Apple ID settings
- Optional (you can disable iCloud for this app in Settings)

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

- **Access:** All your data is visible within the app
- **Export:** You can export your data as PDF or CSV to share with healthcare providers
- **Delete:** You can delete individual entries or all data from within the app
- **Portability:** Exported data is in standard formats you can use elsewhere

## Not a Medical Device

Intestigator is an informational tool only. It surfaces patterns in your logged data but does not diagnose conditions, recommend treatments, or provide medical advice. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for medical concerns.

## Age Requirement

Intestigator is intended for users aged 16 and older.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, we will post the new version here with an updated date.
