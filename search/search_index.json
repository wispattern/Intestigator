They're notorious for gas, bloating, and laxative effects.</p> <p>Note: Check for ingredients ending in \"-ol\" (sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol). \"Sugar-free\" often means sugar alcohols.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#caffeine","title":"Caffeine","text":"<p>What it covers: A stimulant found in coffee, tea, energy drinks, and some sodas.</p> <p>Examples: Coffee, espresso, black tea, green tea, matcha, cola, energy drinks, dark chocolate.</p> <p>Why it matters: Caffeine affects gut motility\u2014it can speed up digestion, causing urgency or loose stools. It can also worsen acid reflux.</p> <p>Note: Decaf still contains small amounts of caffeine. Herbal tea (chamomile, peppermint) is caffeine-free.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#carbonated-drinks","title":"Carbonated Drinks","text":"<p>What it covers: Any beverage with added carbonation.</p> <p>Examples: Soda, sparkling water, seltzer, beer, champagne, kombucha.</p> <p>Why it matters: The carbon dioxide that creates bubbles can cause gas, bloating, and burping. For some, carbonation worsens reflux.</p> <p>Note: Even plain sparkling water can cause issues for sensitive individuals.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#cruciferous-veggies","title":"Cruciferous Veggies","text":"<p>What it covers: Vegetables in the Brassica family, known for their sulfur compounds.</p> <p>Examples: Broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, kale, bok choy, arugula.</p> <p>Why it matters: These vegetables contain raffinose and sulfur compounds that gut bacteria ferment, producing gas and bloating. Cooking may reduce but doesn't eliminate this effect.</p> <p>Note: Despite causing gas, cruciferous vegetables are very nutritious. The issue is usually discomfort, not harm.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#dairy-lactose","title":"Dairy / Lactose","text":"<p>What it covers: Milk and anything made from it.</p> <p>Examples: Milk, cheese, yogurt, cream, butter, ice cream, whey protein, cream sauces.</p> <p>Why it matters: Lactose intolerance is common. Without enough lactase enzyme, dairy causes bloating, gas, cramps, or diarrhea\u2014usually within a few hours.</p> <p>Note: Aged cheeses (cheddar, parmesan) and butter have very little lactose. If you tolerate these but not milk, that's useful information.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#eggs","title":"Eggs","text":"<p>What it covers: Chicken eggs and foods containing them.</p> <p>Examples: Scrambled eggs, omelets, mayonnaise, baked goods, pasta, some sauces.</p> <p>Why it matters: Egg protein sensitivity can cause digestive symptoms like bloating, nausea, or cramping. It's different from a true egg allergy.</p> <p>Note: Some people react to egg whites but not yolks, or vice versa.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#fodmaps","title":"FODMAPs","text":"<p>What it covers: Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols\u2014short-chain carbohydrates that ferment in the gut.</p> <p>Examples: Onions, garlic, apples, pears, watermelon, wheat, milk, honey, beans, lentils, mushrooms, sugar-free products.</p> <p>Why it matters: FODMAPs feed gut bacteria rapidly, producing gas and drawing water into the intestines. People with IBS often find significant relief by reducing high-FODMAP foods.</p> <p>Note: This is a broad category with many subcategories. Not all high-FODMAP foods affect everyone equally\u2014tracking helps identify your specific triggers.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#gluten","title":"Gluten","text":"<p>What it covers: A protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives.</p> <p>Examples: Bread, pasta, beer, crackers, flour tortillas, soy sauce, most baked goods, breaded foods.</p> <p>Why it matters: People with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity experience digestive symptoms, fatigue, or inflammation. Symptoms may appear hours or even a day later.</p> <p>Note: \"Wheat-free\" doesn't always mean gluten-free. Oats are naturally gluten-free but often cross-contaminated.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#high-fat","title":"High-Fat","text":"<p>What it covers: Foods with significant fat content, especially fried or greasy foods.</p> <p>Examples: Fried chicken, bacon, french fries, burgers, creamy sauces, cheese, fatty cuts of meat, pastries.</p> <p>Why it matters: Fat slows digestion and can cause bloating, nausea, or discomfort. It can trigger gallbladder issues and worsen acid reflux.</p> <p>Note: The type of fat matters less than the amount for most digestive symptoms. Avocado and fried food can both cause issues in large quantities.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#histamine-rich","title":"Histamine-Rich","text":"<p>What it covers: Foods naturally high in histamine or that trigger histamine release.</p> <p>Examples: Aged cheese, fermented foods (sauerkraut, kimchi), cured meats, smoked fish, vinegar, alcohol, tomatoes, spinach, avocado.</p> <p>Why it matters: Some people have difficulty breaking down histamine, leading to symptoms like flushing, headaches, and digestive upset. This is sometimes called histamine intolerance or mast cell activation.</p> <p>Note: Freshness matters\u2014histamine builds up as food ages. Leftovers have more histamine than fresh-cooked meals.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#insoluble-fiber","title":"Insoluble Fiber","text":"<p>What it covers: Fiber that doesn't dissolve in water and adds bulk to stool.</p> <p>Examples: Wheat bran, whole grains, nuts, seeds, vegetable skins, celery, corn.</p> <p>Why it matters: While fiber is generally healthy, too much insoluble fiber\u2014especially if you're not used to it\u2014can cause diarrhea, cramping, or urgency.</p> <p>Note: Increasing fiber gradually gives your gut time to adapt. Soluble fiber (oats, bananas) is usually gentler.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#legumes-beans","title":"Legumes / Beans","text":"<p>What it covers: Beans, lentils, peas, and peanuts.</p> <p>Examples: Black beans, kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, hummus, peanuts, peanut butter, edamame.</p> <p>Why it matters: Legumes contain oligosaccharides that humans can't fully digest. Gut bacteria ferment them, producing gas and bloating.</p> <p>Note: Soaking, rinsing, and cooking beans thoroughly can reduce gas. Canned beans may cause fewer issues than dried.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#nightshades","title":"Nightshades","text":"<p>What it covers: Plants in the Solanaceae family, which contain alkaloids.</p> <p>Examples: Tomatoes, potatoes, bell peppers, hot peppers, eggplant, paprika, cayenne.</p> <p>Why it matters: Some people report that nightshades cause gut irritation, joint pain, or inflammation. The connection isn't fully understood, but tracking can reveal if you're sensitive.</p> <p>Note: Nightshade sensitivity is relatively rare but worth exploring if you have unexplained symptoms.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#nuts-seeds","title":"Nuts / Seeds","text":"<p>What it covers: Tree nuts, peanuts (actually a legume), and seeds.</p> <p>Examples: Almonds, walnuts, cashews, peanuts, sunflower seeds, chia seeds, flaxseed, nut butters, tahini.</p> <p>Why it matters: Beyond allergies, nuts and seeds are high in fiber and fat, which can cause bloating or discomfort in large amounts. Some people have trouble digesting them fully.</p> <p>Note: Nut butters and ground seeds may be easier to digest than whole nuts and seeds.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#red-processed-meats","title":"Red / Processed Meats","text":"<p>What it covers: Red meat and processed meat products.</p> <p>Examples: Beef, pork, lamb, bacon, sausage, hot dogs, deli meats, jerky.</p> <p>Why it matters: Red and processed meats are linked to gut inflammation and may be harder to digest than leaner proteins. Processed meats often contain additives that can irritate the gut.</p> <p>Note: How meat is prepared matters\u2014grilled, fried, and processed meats may cause more issues than simply cooked lean cuts.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#shellfish","title":"Shellfish","text":"<p>What it covers: Crustaceans and mollusks.</p> <p>Examples: Shrimp, crab, lobster, clams, mussels, oysters, scallops.</p> <p>Why it matters: Shellfish can trigger histamine reactions and is a common allergen. Even without a true allergy, some people experience digestive upset.</p> <p>Note: Reactions to shellfish can range from mild digestive symptoms to serious allergic reactions. If you suspect an allergy, consult a doctor.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#soy","title":"Soy","text":"<p>What it covers: Soybeans and soy-derived products.</p> <p>Examples: Tofu, soy milk, edamame, soy sauce, tempeh, miso, many meat substitutes and protein bars.</p> <p>Why it matters: Soy is a common allergen and may cause digestive issues. It's also linked to eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in some people. Soy is in many processed foods, making it easy to consume unknowingly.</p> <p>Note: Fermented soy (miso, tempeh, soy sauce) may be easier to digest than unfermented soy (tofu, soy milk).</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#spicy","title":"Spicy","text":"<p>What it covers: Foods containing chili peppers or hot spices.</p> <p>Examples: Hot sauce, jalape\u00f1os, curry, buffalo wings, kimchi, salsa, Thai food, sriracha.</p> <p>Why it matters: Capsaicin (the compound that makes peppers hot) can irritate the digestive tract, causing heartburn, stomach cramps, or urgency. Effects are usually quick.</p> <p>Note: \"Spicy\" is subjective. Tag foods that feel spicy to you, even if others wouldn't consider them hot.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#other","title":"Other","text":"<p>What it covers: A catch-all for items that don't fit other categories.</p> <p>Examples: Unusual ingredients, supplements, medications, or foods you want to track that aren't covered elsewhere.</p> <p>Why it matters: Sometimes you suspect something specific that doesn't have its own tag. \"Other\" lets you track it and see if patterns emerge.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tag-reference/#tips-for-using-tags","title":"Tips for Using Tags","text":"<ul> <li>Confirm only what applies \u2014 Your oat milk latte has caffeine but no dairy</li> <li>When in doubt, confirm it \u2014 You can always edit later if you learn more</li> <li>Watch for hidden ingredients \u2014 Soy sauce has gluten; many sauces have dairy</li> <li>Track what matters to you \u2014 If you never react to caffeine, you can skip that tag</li> <li>Use \"Other\" freely \u2014 If you suspect something specific, track it</li> </ul> <p>See Tags &amp; Ingredients for how tags work in the app.</p>"},{"location":"logging/tags-and-ingredients/","title":"Tags &amp; Ingredients","text":"<p>Tags and ingredients help Intestigator analyze your data and find patterns.
